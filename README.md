# ML-Fundamentals

This repository contains some of the fundamental ideas in Machine Learning. Broadly, there are three aspects to a Machine Learning Model:

- **Data Collection**
- **Data Processing**
- **Model Fitting and Analysis**

There are several interesting ideas in all three disciplines, and we will explore these ideas from a practical perspective.

Further, after fitting the model, we often want to know if there is a causal interpretation. This leads to the concept of **Causal Inference**, which we will also investigate.
